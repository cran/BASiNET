Description: It makes the creation of networks from sequences of RNA, with this is done the abstraction of characteristics of these networks with a methodology of threshold for the purpose of making a classification between the classes of the sequences. There are four data present in the 'BASiNET' package, "sequences", "sequences2", "sequences-predict" and "sequences2-predict" with 11, 10, 11 and 11 sequences respectively. These sequences were taken from the data set used in the article (LI, Aimin; ZHANG, Junying; ZHOU, Zhongyin, 2014) <doi:10.1186/1471-2105-15-311>, these sequences are used to run examples. The BASiNET was published on Nucleic Acids Research, (ITO, Eric; KATAHIRA, Isaque; VICENTE, Fábio; PEREIRA, Felipe; LOPES, Fabrício, 2018) <doi:10.1093/nar/gky462>.
