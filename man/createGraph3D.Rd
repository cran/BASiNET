\title{Creates an untargeted graph from a biological sequence}
\usage{
createGraph3D(matrix1, matrix2, numSeqMRNA, numSeqLNCRNA, nameMeasure1,
  nameMeasure2)
}
\arguments{
\item{matrix1}{matrix of the first measure for the creation of the three-dimensional chart}

\item{matrix2}{matrix of the second measure for the creation of the three-dimensional chart}

\item{numSeqMRNA}{number of mRNA sequences}

\item{numSeqLNCRNA}{number of lncRNA sequences}

\item{nameMeasure1}{name of the first measure to put in the title of the graph}

\item{nameMeasure2}{name of the second measure to put in the title of the graph}
}
\value{
Returns the non-directed graph formed through the sequence
}
\description{
A function that from a biological sequence generates a graph not addressed having as words vertices, this being able to have its size parameter set by the' word 'parameter. The connections between words depend of the' step 'parameter that indicates the next connection to be formed
